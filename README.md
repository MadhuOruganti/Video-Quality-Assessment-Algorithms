Abtsrcat: 
Modelling of functions of visual cortex and 
optical flow field has made it possible to 
develop many sophisticated human visual system-based 
visual quality assessment algorithms. 
There exist very few video quality 
assessment algorithms which consider spatio-temporal distortions effectively.

In this article, based on the direction of optical flow field, 
we propose a full reference video quality algorithm. 
We claim that some temporal distortions, which are present 
in other directions than the majority of optical flow field 
directions, can not be easily perceivable by the human observer; 
hence it results in reduced video quality scores.

Our proposed method achieved high video quality score and higher correlation 
with formally existed algorithm and near to the objective scores. 
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the state of art.

The use of statistical features of optical flow: mean, 
standard deviation of flow magnitudes and minimum eigenvalue
of optical flow patch's covariance matrix, in measuring the 
distortion levels is well demonstrated in the state of art [1].

We hypothesize that when there is a higher random 
flow in both the reference video and distorted video, 
then the temporal annoyance level 
is low which result in reduced distortion scores. 
Based on this hypothesis, we present an HVS
based full reference video quality assessment 
algorithm based on optical flow. 
The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed model improves the state of art.

Full reference video quality assessment based on optical flow is emerging.
Human Visual System (HVS) based video quality assessment algorithms are
playing an important role in effectively assessing the distortions in video sequences. 
There exist very few video quality assessment algorithms which consider
spatio-temporal distortions effectively. 

To address the above issues, we present an enhanced optical flow based 
full reference video quality algorithm which considers the
orientation feature of the optical flow while computing
the temporal distortions as opposed to the use of feature, 
minimum eigenvalue as in the state of the art.

Further, it presents an interquartile range based comparative weighted 
closeness (INT-CWC) measure which aimed to measure the 
comparative dispersion of video quality scores of any
two video quality assessment algorithms with DMOS scores. 
Here INT-CWC measure is a novel attempt. 
The performance of proposed scheme is evaluated using the 
LIVE dataset and scheme is shown to be competitive with,
and even out-perform, existing video quality assessment algorithms.
